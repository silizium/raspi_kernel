# raspi_kernel
A collection of some ready for use Raspi real-time kernels. 

Just a hopefully growning collection of ready to use kernels. The compiling and setup is taking a lot of time on a Raspbian and not everybody can make a cross compile setup. The things to do are usually very simple. 

Copy the file into your /tmp directory, enter it on console, terminal, ssh and:

```
sudo rm -r /boot/overlays/ /lib/firmware
cd /tmp
tar xzf <KERNELFILE>.tgz
sudo cp -rd lib /
sudo cp -rd boot /
sudo shutdown -r now
```
If you are using rpi-update, execute the rpi-update *before* you insert the new Kernel, because it would be overwritten.

Kernel from here:

I just compiled the Kernel (takes about a week on a Raspi 1B) and I do provide the result here. Do with it, what you like but don't blame me if it is not working or you are wrecking everything or so. 

I compiled that thing with a cross compiling process with a gcc 6.3 or did I use the toolchain? Whatever. It works for me.
